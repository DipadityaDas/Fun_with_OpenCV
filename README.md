# 🚀 Fun with Python OpenCV and NumPy Modules

>✅ This task was given by Mr. Vimal Daga in [ARTH - The School of technologies](https://rightarth.com/) and Summer Internship in [LinuxWorld India](https://www.lwindia.com/). 

## ⚡ OpenCV
>OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel). The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License. Starting with 2011, OpenCV features GPU acceleration for real-time operations.

## ⚡ NumPy 
>NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors.
